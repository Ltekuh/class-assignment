Activity 2
Study the different ways of cloning a repo from github.

We need to be aware that these are both protocols in the first place SSH: Port 22 and https: port 443
SSH uses a public key for authentication meanwhile with https, you use a username and password. Whatever 
measure is used, the repo is been cloned into your local and from there you can use it or implement changes 
to the original code. One thing for sure is, it is much more easier to clone https than ssh.

Keep in mind that since your short story is, well, shorter than a novel, you may remove a few steps. Knowing the 
overall character journey, however, can be helpful for your main character development within short stories.
Spend enough time on character development when you’re learning how to write a short story or improving your
creative writing skills will pay off by introducing your readers to memorable characters.
Learning how to write a short story forces you to think of ways to take your reader on a journey in a much shorter space than a book.
And that means they have to have a core theme or message you want to get across. This can be anything from loving yourself to ignoring 
societal expectations.
In order to do this, think about what you want people to walk away from your story feeling.
What is the desired outcome?
If you just want people to enjoy the story, that’s great. However, what makes a story impactful and enjoyable is what readers take away from it.
Brainstorm some themes that are important to you and work your short story around them. When you understand how to write a short story this way, 
it will not only make you care about your story more (which means it’ll be written better), but it’ll also make it more satisfying for readers.
